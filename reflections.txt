Your response goes here!

	1.  I have learned to be more carefull with my HTML markup, 
            Indentation and tag syntax is important.
		
	2.  It has been easy to get set up with the projects, because I already
	    have an IDE and a little previous knowledge and experience
            that helped me to get going.

	3.  It has been difficult for me to devote the time necessary to 
            complete all of the tasks that need to be accomplished.

	4.  I like how Udacity is teaching in stages.  I feel that 
             each lesson is forming the foundation for the next.  Concepts
             I learn are reinforced through immediate use and repetition.
